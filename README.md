This R package serves as a dumping ground for bits of code that I find useful or don't want to have to rebuild regularly.  At some point I'll write a package manifest, but it's minimal for now.

## Installation

You can install CMutils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chrismainey/CMutils")
```
